Hello, my name is **Dennire Sanchez** and I am originally from Venezuela. 
In 2013 I finished my **Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering** in the University of Carabobo, Venezuela. 
A few years later, I decided to change my career path and went for a **Cloud Support Engineer program** at Miami Dade College and graduated in 2019.

Soon I will be getting my **AWS Cloud Pactitioner Certification** in 2019. Next to this I want to become an **AWS Solutions Architect**

I consider myself an accomplished Engineer, **passionate learner**, well-versed in achieving and exceeding goals through **management and strategy development.**

I'm looking for new opportunities to grow as a professional.
